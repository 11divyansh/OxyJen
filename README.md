# OxyJen🫧

**OxyJen** is the missing AI framework for Java & JVM enterprises.  
Think of it as *AI Oxygen for Java* — tools and workflows designed for banks, HFTs, and infra-heavy organizations.  

## Vision
- Bring AI orchestration (LangChain/LangGraph style) to Java.  
- Build enterprise-first modules: Spring Config Analyzer, GC/JVM Log Analyzer, Secure Workflow Engine.  
- Focus on **performance, security, and observability** — because enterprises need more than toys.

## 🤝 Contributing
OxyJen is at its early stage — ideas, discussions, and contributions are welcome!
